# **Dcodeblock Hackathon Assignment**


## **Introduction**

For the DCodeBlock assignment, I developed a Home page using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP. The assignment involved implementing sophisticated design elements, including complex buttons and various design logic.


## **Technologies Used**

- React JS: For building the user interface.

- TypeScript: For adding type safety and improving code quality.

- Tailwind CSS: For streamlined styling.

- GSAP: minimalistic sidebar on mobile view.

## **Installation**

To set up this assignment locally, follow these steps:


**Clone the repository:**

```bash
https://github.com/hr-ishi94/dcodeblock-hackathon
```
**Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd cd dcodeblock-hackathon
```
**Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```
**Build the project:**

```bash
npm run build
```
**Start the development server:**

```bash
npm start
```
**Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5173/ to view the app.**



## **Challenges Faced**

One of the biggest challenges I faced was creating the complex button, which took a significant amount of time. I conducted extensive research and eventually solved it by using two SVGs, allowing me to complete the task on time.

Another challenge was implementing GSAP, as I was unfamiliar with it. I took some time to learn the basics and successfully used it to create a minimalistic sidebar for mobile views.
